# On Time

When I bought my first camera, I didn't know what to photograph. Pictures of people always felt forced to me, either posed and pruned, or candid, inconsequential, non-consensual. 

Landscapes are lovely, but taking a photo of another sunset or flower, while sometimes majestic, ultimately struck me as banal. I was searching for a subject that conveyed a sense of time and rhythm, that suggested a history, presented a mystery. 

I was 28 years old when with my first professional camera, a Sony A7S mkii, I found myself in Tokyo exploring the metropolis through my new camera's lens. I learned its basic functions by documenting the architecture and fish markets, the bustle and sakura in bloom, but eventually discovered my photographic muse not in nature, society or still life, but in the textures I encountered while getting lost in a city that was foreign to me. 

Textures: the concrete decay of an urban jungle, the scales of a still-bleeding tuna on ice, the irregular vertical repetition of a rusted iron grate, chipped paint and wood grain of a fence past prime; They suggest a story of man vs. nature, a chronicle of entropy as our best laid attempts at order succumb to the elements, past tense perfection lost to time, the tension of indifferent environments slowly laying claim to our intention.

I must have appeared quite silly finding my niche, zooming in on rocks, walls, and cracks in the streets amidst a sea of tourists pointing their Galaxy S III at the pastel pastiche of cherry blossoms or a willow tree.

Since 2015, my tradition of getting lost on such a scavenger hunt when first arriving in a new locale has been going strong. I've come to enjoy quiet walks through cities and villages, forests and farmhouses, cataloguing my travel through the patterns that present themselves on these meditative meanderings whilst texture collecting. 

These images have found practical use outside of just a collection of still images, used as dirt maps and grunge layers in graphic design and VJ work, back drops in projection mapped scenic design for events and theater, and have become a special way for me to reconnect with the time and place in which I shot them. Each image evokes a personal memory, bringing me back to warehouses in Berlin, a back alley in London, the graffiti'd walls of a squat in Barcelona or an underpass in New York, affording me an intimate way to inject the unique texture of that time and place into other multi-media art works and compositions.
