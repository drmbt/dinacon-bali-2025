# Chron Jobs

Dinacon's unofficial gig board for those short on funding but long on mosquito bites.  

🐚 **Shell Whisperer**  
Must be fluent in mollusk. Translate crab murmurs into machine-readable formats. BYO hydrophone.

🔋 **Coconut Power Grid Intern** _(Unpaid)_  
Harvest fallen coconuts. Convince them they're batteries. Die of heatstroke.

🌊 **Seawater Sommelier**  
_*Swirls tidewater in a cracked mason jar*_  
I'm detecting notes of reef rot, motor oil, and 15 year coral aged cyanide

📡 **Off-Grid Wi-Fi Shaman**  
Win the favor of lesser bandwidth spirits via sunrise rituals involving banana leaves, rice grains, and unflinching eye-contact with a passing Starlink 

🌿 **Plantfluencer**  
Photosynthesize clout by posting thirst-traps with succulents #blessed #LesIsMore #LateStageCapitalism

🛠️ **Open Source Compliance Gestapo**  
Perform surprise inspections on software stacks, shaming violators via passive-aggressive README edits for using technology maintained by someone that earns a salary

🖋️ **Grant Writer**  
Reframe "gluing beach garbage to driftwood" as a hands-on critique of late-stage capitalism, using found-object semiotics to explore decolonial environmental narratives.
